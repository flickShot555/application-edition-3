\section{Functional Requirements}

The Fake AI Voice Detection App is designed to empower users by offering real-time monitoring and analysis of voice calls, specifically targeting conversations in the Urdu language. It enables users to initiate voice monitoring during calls, where an intelligent machine learning model continuously evaluates the speech to detect AI-generated or synthetic voices. Upon identifying a potential fake voice, the app promptly alerts the user with a clear notification, enhancing their ability to respond appropriately. The app also logs all detection results, allows users to review and provide feedback, and ensures all data is securely stored. With features like Urdu language filtering, pause/resume functionality, and encrypted storage, the app prioritizes accuracy, transparency, and user control in a secure and privacy-respecting environment.
