The ConstituCheck is a much needed solution by the commoners of Pakistan. We, the common people of Pakistan, are mostly unaware of the legal constraints of our constitution, and access to legal experts is also not very easy to everyone. It is a common observation that people mostly end up doing something and only after that, do they come to know what repurcussions are they going to face. sometimes they end up being a victim of some act and they dont know what power do the constitution gives them. Here, the legal experts fail to present an unbiased evaluation of the person's scenario, an act which discourages the people to contact the legal experts. to bridge this gap of unawareness between the common people of Pakistan and the legal experts, we present the 'ConstituCheck'. An application that gives a complete unbiased analysis of a user's observed scenario, against the very act of constitution that is drafted for that act in the user's scenario. This way, the commoner of Pakistan would get the knowledge of the legal matter at his convinience and completely unbias at the same time.
